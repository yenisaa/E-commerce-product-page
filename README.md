# E-commerce Product Page (Frontend Mentor Challenge)


This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

At this stage, the project includes only the HTML and CSS implementation. I’ll be adding TypeScript soon to handle the interactive parts (gallery, lightbox, cart, etc.).
